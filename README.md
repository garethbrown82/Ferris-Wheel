# FerrisWheel
I created this animated landscape to experiment with different types of 2D CSS animations. I created it on an iPad using TextTastic which is why it is locked to the size it is. The animated landscape includes a spinning ferris wheel, flying bird and a moving sun what sets and rises with the landscape turning dark and stars coming out once the sun has set.
